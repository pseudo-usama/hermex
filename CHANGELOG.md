# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `Gemini` file upload updated for the latest UI: the upload-menu button's `aria-label` changed from `Open upload file menu` to `Upload & tools`, and the "Upload files" trigger is now located via the shared `images-files-uploader[data-test-id="uploader-images-files-button-advanced"]` wrapper so it resolves correctly in both the maximized and narrow/mobile menu layouts

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- Corrected documentation for ChatGPT login requirements — file upload works without login; only image generation requires a logged-in session
- `ChatGPT.get_state()` now correctly returns `GENERATING` during image generation — after a recent ChatGPT UI update, the stop button disappears while the image loading skeleton is still visible, causing the state to appear idle prematurely; fixed by additionally checking for `[data-testid="image-gen-loading-state"]`
- `ChatGPT.get_last_response()` no longer raises a spurious "neither text nor image" error on image-only responses — the `<img>` tag is now awaited for up to 5 seconds to account for the brief DOM delay after the loading skeleton clears

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- `SUPPORTED_ATTACHMENTS` class constant on `Gemini` and `ChatGPT` — exposes the set of allowed file extensions per platform

### Changed
- `images` parameter renamed to `attachments` in `send_message()`, `query()`, and `simple_query()` across both scrapers
- Supported upload types expanded from images only to include `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.gif`, `.webp`

### Fixed
- `ChatGPT._detect_login()` now uses `WebDriverWait` with `TimeoutException` instead of a bare `find_element` with `except Exception`, consistent with Gemini's approach
- `_detect_chrome_version()` now raises a clear `RuntimeError` when Chrome is not found, the subprocess fails, or the version string cannot be parsed — previously crashed with a cryptic `TypeError` or `AttributeError`
- `close()` now calls `self._temp_dir.cleanup()` to release the temporary download directory
- `setup()` browser-close detection now catches `WebDriverException` instead of bare `Exception`, and wraps the loop in `try/finally` to guarantee `close()` is always called
- `_get_downloaded_file()` now filters out `.crdownload` partial files to avoid returning incomplete downloads
- `simple_query()` now wraps the query in `try/finally` so the browser is always closed even if an exception is raised
- File existence is now checked before upload in both scrapers — raises `FileNotFoundError` with a clear message instead of a cryptic driver error
- `TemporaryDirectory` creation moved from `__init__` to `_initialize_driver()` so its lifecycle matches the driver — reusing an instance after `close()` no longer points Chrome at a deleted download directory, and calling `close()` twice is now a safe no-op
